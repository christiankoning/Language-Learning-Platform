        Speaking vs Writing in Japanese
    </h1>

    <div class="prose prose-invert max-w-none">
        <p class="mb-4">
            Learning Japanese involves two important but different skills: <strong>speaking</strong> and <strong>writing</strong>. They are connected, but they also have different challenges and goals.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Speaking Japanese</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            When speaking, your focus is on pronunciation, natural phrasing, and being understood. It's okay to make small grammar mistakes — communication is the goal!
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Spoken Japanese also uses a lot of casual forms, contractions, and even slang that you won't always see in textbooks.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Writing Japanese</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Writing requires accuracy, proper Kanji usage, and a good understanding of grammar. It's generally more formal and organized than spoken language.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Reading and writing in Japanese will also expose you to set phrases and fixed structures used in letters, emails, and literature.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Different Goals, Same Foundation</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Whether your goal is conversation, travel, manga reading, or business communication — the foundation is the same: <strong>hiragana, katakana, basic grammar, and essential vocabulary</strong>.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
            Focus first on building your core knowledge, and then you can decide whether to practice speaking, writing, or both more seriously.
        </p>

        <p>
            In this platform, you will get exposure to both — making sure you are prepared no matter which path you choose!
